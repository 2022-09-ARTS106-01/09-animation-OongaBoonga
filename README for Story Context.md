Ed Almost Gets MUGGED

Our story picks up right where we left off last year. Our adorable little protagonist Ed finds a wad of cash on the ground and is squishing with joy, but the nearby
mob boss rectangle is not having it. The boss wades over to our innocent friend and pulls a gun on him. Out of fear, Ed picks up the cash and smacks the mobster across
the face so hard that the mob boss flips around and passes out. Ed is beyond excited that money grants abilities one can only dream of, and swiftly dashes away.
